2. **AI Analysis**: The image is analyzed by AI, and a recipe prompt is generated.
3. **Recipe Creation**: AI returns a detailed recipe, which is saved to the PostgreSQL database.
4. **Gallery Display**: Recipes are cached in Redis for efficient loading and displayed in a gallery.
5. **Interactive View**: Click on any dish in the gallery to view its full details.
